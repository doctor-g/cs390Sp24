# Preproduction Schedule

## General Instructions

This page contains the projected schedule for the semester. Alterations to the
schedule will be discussed or announced in a meeting or via Canvas.

### Exercises

Most of our meeting days require you to prepare and present something.
The work that goes into this, and the artifact that results, is the
_exercise_. They are called &ldquo;exercises&rdquo; because they strengthen
your preproduction skills. 
Plan to submit a copy of your exercises on Canvas for formal evaluation
by the professors.

Part of the expectation for full participation credit is that you have the exercise
completed. However, even if you miss this opportunity to participate, you still
have the opportunity to complete and resubmit exercises. This ensures that
all of you can have a reasonable expectation of shared experiences when it comes
to collaborating on work. See the [course plan](course_plan.md) for policies
around resubmission of exercises.

### Posters

Many of your individual explorations will be presented in the form of a _poster_.
A subset of posters that are brought into a meeting will be selected for presentation
and discussion.
For our purposes, the poster is an artifact that represents your understanding.
The poster must be on at least letter-size paper, although you may make larger
ones as you see fit. The posters are _intermediary work products_. That means that
they are something we make in order to an express an idea, and that learning from
the valuable part, and then they will be thrown away. Put another way, don't spend
money on your posters. That said, a good poster will be clearly composed and not something
thrown together five minutes before a meeting.

The contents must be clearly visible by our community while
the poster is presented. This has important implications for its composition.
Text must be very large, clear visuals are helpful, and colors may be useful for
emphasis. Keep in mind that the goal of the poster is to represent your understanding.
Make that part as clear as possible. 

Lest it go unnoticed, the ability to take a concept and express it in simple visual
form is a crucial skill for aspiring game designers. 

### File Formats

All work that is submitted for evaluation must be in [open file
formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_file_format) that do not require
proprietary software to reliably open. Here is a quick guide for those
to whom this is a new practice.

- Images should be in PNG or JPG
- Textual work whose format is irrelevant should be in plain text (.TXT, .MD) 
  or ODT
- Multimodal work, or composed work where layout is crucial, should be in PDF

Note that most Adobe and Microsoft Office formats are specifically excluded
from the recommendations.

## Tuesday, Jan 30
### Policy
- By the end of the prototype phase each student must have completed
  at least one digital prototype and one physical prototype
- Each prototype must explore a different design idea; that is, you should
  explore new design directions rather than refine a previous prototype.
  You may take inspiration from a classmate's prototype and explore different
  aspects of it. Keep in mind that this is still the _ideation_ phase. 
  There will be time for refinement after we find the best core.
