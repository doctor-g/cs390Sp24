# Preproduction Schedule

## General Instructions

This page contains the projected schedule for the semester. Alterations to the
schedule will be discussed or announced in a meeting or via Canvas.

Many of your individual explorations will be presented in the form of a _poster_.
A subset of posters that are brought into a meeting will be selected for presentation
and discussion.
For our purposes, the poster is an artifact that represents your understanding.
The poster must be on at least letter-size paper, although you may make larger
ones as you see fit. The posters are _intermediary work products_. That means that
they are something we make in order to an express an idea, and that learning from
the valuable part, and then they will be thrown away. Put another way, don't spend
money on your posters. That said, a good poster will be clearly composed and not something
one whips up five minutes before a meeting.

The contents must be clearly visible by our community while
the poster is presented. This has important implications for its composition.
Text must be very large, clear visuals are helpful, and colors may be useful for
emphasis. Keep in mind that the goal of the poster is to represent your understanding.
Make that part as clear as possible. 

Lest it go unnoticed, the ability to take a concept and express it in simple visual
form is a crucial skill for aspiring game designers to develop. 

## Tuesday, Jan 9
### Meeting
- Introduction to the class

## Thursday, Jan 11
### Prepare
- Read Lemarchand Introduction, Chapters 1&dash;2 (Getting Started, Blue Sky Thinking: ~12 pages)
- Complete the automatic writing, mind map, or another approved blue-sky
  ideation technique for a minimum of 20 minutes. Prepare a poster
  summarizing your findings.
### Meeting
- Present posters
- Brainstorming following Lemarchand's process

## Tuesday, Jan 16
### Prepare
- Read Lemarchand 3&ndash;4 (Research, Game Prototyping: ~14 pages)
- Do two different forms of research from the reading based on our brainstorming
  results. Prepare a poster summarizing your results
### Meeting
- Present research notes
- Begin physical prototypes based on research

## Thursday, Jan 18
### Prepare
- Complete a physical prototype, based on research, in approximately three hours
### Meeting
- Demonstrate prototypes

## Tuesday, Jan 23
### Prepare
- Read Lemarchand 5 (Digital Prototyping: 11 pages)
- Prepare yourself for digital prototyping: prototyping tools, asset packs, etc.
### Meeting
- Complete a one-hour digital prototype
- Share in small groups

## Thursday, Jan 25
### Prepare
- Read Lemarchand 6 (Communication: 9 pages)
- Prepare a poster of the most important takeaway from the reading
### Meeting
- Share posters
- Start prototyping

## Tuesday, Jan 30
### Policy
- By the end of the prototype phase each student must have completed
  at least one digital prototype and one physical prototype
- Each prototype must explore a different design idea; that is, you should
  explore new design directions rather than refine a previous prototype.
  You may take inspiration from a classmate's prototype and explore different
  aspects of it. Keep in mind that this is still the _ideation_ phase. 
  There will be time for refinement after we find the best core.
### Prepare
- Complete a prototype. Answer the reflective questions from Lemarchand p23 in a
  brief submitted report. 
### Meeting

## Tuesday, Feb 13
### Prepare
- Complete fifth prototype as described above
- Pick at most two prototypes (yours or classmates) to champion for
  consideration as capstone projects
- Read Lemarchand 7 (Project Goals: 14 pages)
- Read Lemarchand 8 (End of Ideation: 2 pages)
### Meeting
