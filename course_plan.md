Game Preproduction, Spring 2024, at Ball State University.

## Course Information

- **Instructors**: 
    - [Paul Gestwicki](https://www.cs.bsu.edu/~pvgestwicki) (Office: RB479, see website for drop-in hours)

This is the first course in a three-course capstone experience for students in
the Game Design & Development Concentration. At the end of the class, you and
your teammates will pitch a game to a board of industry professionals. This
pitch will consist of a vertical slice, a game design macro, and a schedule.
Projects approved by the board will be moved into production next academic year,
at the end of which time, they will be published to Steam.

The catalog description for CS390 follows:

> Explore the pre-production process of videogame development by investigating
> technical, artistic, feasibility, and methodological aspects. Rapidly
> prototype videogame ideas in order to discover practicable concepts. Form
> multidisciplinary teams to build a publicly showcased vertical slice.




## Commitment

This is a three credit-hour class, and so you are expected to invest nine hours
of focused effort per week. Six of these will be in our regularly scheduled
meetings each week, and you will be responsible for scheduling your other three
yourself. Preproduction is a time of creativity and constraint, and learning to
manage your time and scope your project is part of our work this semester.


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course sequence, a student will be able to:

- Identify and evaluate factors that contribute to the potential business
  success for videogames, such as choice of tools, platform, genre, and
  distribution method

- Rapidly prototype game software concepts in order to identify good mechanisms
  for original games

- Collaborate across disciplinary backgrounds to develop game concepts into
  high-fidelity prototypes or vertical slices

- Develop and present a videogame production plan


## Schedule

We will follow the advice given by Lemarchand.
We will use the first third of our capstone for preproduction: that is this course.
The first 15% of our time will be on ideation, taking us to mid-February. The remainder
of the semester will be spent developing the major deliverables of preproduction:
the macro document, the production schedule, and the vertical slice.
These will be presented to our advisory board in a meeting tentatively scheduled
for April 23.

Refer to [the schedule page](schedule.md) for all the details.

## Decorum

Your learning is commensurate to your participation, and so attendance is
expected. You are responsible for your learning regardless of attendance. If you
miss a meeting, you should consult with trusted classmates to ensure you
are caught up.

We will begin our meetings on time, which means you should arrive a few minutes
beforehand. This gives you adequate time to get situated and exchange greetings
with your colleagues. Recognize that it is inconsiderate to miss or be late to a
meeting. Should you be in a position where tardiness or absence is inevitable,
consider bringing treats to a future meeting by way of apology: your classmates
will not forget this show of respect.

Stow your phone in silent mode for the duration of meetings. If you anticipate
receipt of a communiqu√© so critical as to merit interrupting a meeting, it is
certainly better not to be in that meeting at all.

If we are not actively using laptops in a class activity, stow those as well.
When we are using laptops for an activity, shut down your social networking and
messaging software and disable notifications so as to maintain focus on the work
at hand. If you are giving a presentation, either alone or with a team, ensure
that your laptop is ready before the meeting starts so that you can focus on
your classmates' presentations.

Always have paper and a writing implement on hand during meetings so that you
are ready to take notes or record questions. The most frequent lie that we tell
ourselves is, &ldquo;I will remember this.&rdquo; Transcribing your notes after
the meeting is an excellent way to study, if not the best way. It will help you
structure your experience and strengthen your understanding. If you want to do
your transcription on a computer rather than on paper, that's up to you. Be
careful, though, not to delude yourself into thinking that your distraction
machine is an appropriate replacement for a notebook.

Listen actively. Assume the speaker knows something you do not. Listening this
way means you are not simply waiting for your chance to speak. More often, you
are asking probing questions in order to build a better understanding of the
other person's experience.

Most of our face-to-face communication is non-verbal; a corollary is that it is
easy to misread someone's intention in text. Keep in mind _The Rule of Three
Interpretations_. If you read something that rankles you&mdash;whether it
appears to be bull-headed, offensive, or just plain wrong&mdash;pause for a
moment. Think of three different possible interpretations of the text. The odds
are that the most charitable one is correct.

## Evaluation and Grades

Your final grade is determined by your engagement with four aspects of the
course according to the following table. Your letter grade in the course is the
minimum row for which you have satisfied all of the criteria, and a student who
does not meet the criteria for a D receives an F.

### Participation and Deadlines

Each meeting is an opportunity to learn together.
Satisfactory participation means that you have brought any materials
required for the day and that you have engaged in productive studio time.

Full participation also requires that you are ready to begin work
at the start of the meeting and stay attentive throughout.
This requires being present in the studio early enough to get situated
and exchange pleasantries with your colleagues. 
Recognize that being late to a meeting, leaving early from one, or
otherwise causing disruption is an impediment to your and your classmates' learning.

### Exercises

The semester will include many exercises that will help you understand game
preproduction, especially during ideation in the first several weeks of the semester. Sometimes, work on these exercises starts in the studio, but most or all
will require using your out-of-studio time for independent completion.

Learning from these exercises is a crucial part of our process, and so we are
adopting a &ldquo;mastery learning&rdquo; evaluation process for your
submissions. That is, you may resubmit your exercises as many times as necessary
to demonstrate satisfactory understanding. In order to keep students and faculty
from falling behind on our respective responsibilities, you are limited to one
exercise resubmission per week, with the start of the week measured from 12:30
on Tuesdays&mdash;our first meeting of each week.


### Completion

Your final deliverables of the semester include the game design macro, the
schedule, the vertical slice, and the pitch presentation to the Games Advisory
Board. Each of these will be satisfactory if they are completed on time and meet
the criteria established in the text.

### Final Exam

The final exam will be given as scheduled by the university.
Our final will be from noon to 2&nbsp;P.M. on the Tuesday of finals week.


## Miscellany

### Academic Integrity

following or a mild variation be included on all course plans:

> Ball State University aspires to be a university that attracts and retains a
> diverse faculty, staff, and student body. We are committed to ensuring that
> all members of the community are welcome, through valuing the various
> experiences and worldviews represented at Ball State and among those we serve.
