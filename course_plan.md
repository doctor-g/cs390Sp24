The catalog description for CS390 follows:

> Explore the pre-production process of videogame development by investigating
> technical, artistic, feasibility, and methodological aspects. Rapidly
> prototype videogame ideas in order to discover practicable concepts. Form
> multidisciplinary teams to build a publicly showcased vertical slice.

This is the first course in a three-course capstone experience for students in
the Game Design & Development Concentration. At the end of the class, you and
your teammates will pitch a game to a board of industry professionals. This
pitch will consist of a vertical slice, a game design macro, and a schedule.
Those projects that are approved by the board will be undertaken by teams for
production in the production sequence next academic year and publicly released.

## Commitment

This is a three credit-hour class, and so you are expected to invest nine hours
of focused effort per week. Six of these will be in our regularly scheduled
meetings each week, and you will be responsible for scheduling your other three
yourself. Preproduction is a time of creativity and constraint, and learning to
manage your time and scope your project is part of our work this semester.


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course sequence, a student will be able to:

- Identify and evaluate factors that contribute to the potential business
  success for videogames, such as choice of tools, platform, genre, and
  distribution method

- Rapidly prototype game software concepts in order to identify good mechanisms
  for original games

- Collaborate across disciplinary backgrounds to develop game concepts into
  high-fidelity prototypes or vertical slices

- Develop and present a videogame production plan


## Schedule

We will follow the advice given by Lemarchand.
We will use the first third of our capstone for preproduction: that is this course.
The first 15% of our time will be on ideation, taking us to mid-February. The remainder
of the semester will be spent developing the major deliverables of preproduction:
the macro document, the production schedule, and the vertical slice.
These will be presented to our advisory board in a meeting tentatively scheduled
for April 23.

Refer to [the schedule page](schedule.md) for all the details.

Following university policy, expect a meeting during our scheduled final exam period.

## Decorum

Your learning is commensurate to your participation, and so attendance is
expected. You are responsible for your learning regardless of attendance. If you
miss a class meeting, you should consult with trusted classmates to ensure you
are caught up.

We will begin our meetings on time, which means you should arrive a few minutes
beforehand. This gives you adequate time to get situated and exchange greetings
with your classmates. Recognize that it is inconsiderate to miss or be late to a
meeting. Should you be in a position where tardiness or absence is inevitable,
consider bringing treats to a future meeting by way of apology: your classmates
will not forget this show of respect.

Stow your phone in silent mode for the duration of meetings. If you anticipate
receipt of a communiqu√© so critical as to merit interrupting a meeting, it is
certainly better not to be in that meeting at all. Remember that online meetings
are meetings, too.

If we are not actively using laptops in a class activity, stow those as well.
When we are using laptops for an activity, shut down your social networking and
messaging software and disable notifications so as to maintain focus on the work
at hand. If you are giving a presentation, either alone or with a team, ensure
that your laptop is ready before the meeting starts so that you can focus on
your classmates' presentations.

Always have paper and a writing implement on hand during meetings so that you
are ready to take notes or record questions. The most frequent lie that we tell
ourselves is, &ldquo;I will remember this.&rdquo; Transcribing your notes after
the meeting is an excellent way to study, if not the best way. It will help you
structure your experience and strengthen your understanding. If you want to do
your transcription on a computer rather than on paper, that's up to you. Be
careful, though, not to delude yourself into thinking that your distraction
machine is an appropriate replacement for a notebook.

Listen actively. Assume the speaker knows something you do not. Listening this
way means you are not simply waiting for your chance to speak. More often, you
are asking probing questions in order to build a better understanding of the
other person's experience.

Most of our face-to-face communication is non-verbal; a corollary is that it is
easy to misread someone's intention in text. Keep in mind _The Rule of Three
Interpretations_. If you read something that rankles you&mdash;whether it
appears to be bull-headed, offensive, or just plain wrong&mdash;pause for a
moment. Think of three different possible interpretations of the text. The odds
are that the most charitable one is correct.
